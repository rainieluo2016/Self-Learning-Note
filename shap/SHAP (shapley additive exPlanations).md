# Overview

- concept from cooperative game theory
- understand the prediction by computing the contribution of each feature to the prediction

---

# Cooperative Game Theory

## Coalition

- a group or a subset of players who come together and cooperate to achieve a common goal or to maximize their combined value
- **Formation** - The coalition can include any number of players from the entire set, ranging from a single player to the entire group (referred to as the "grand coalition").
    - For example, if you have three players $A$, $B$, and $C$, the possible coalitions are:
        - Single-player coalitions: $\{ A\}$, $\{ B\}$, $\{ C\}$
        - Two-player coalitions: $\{ A, B \}$, $\{ A, C \}$, $\{ B, C \}$
        - The grand coalition (all players):  $\{ A, B, C \}$
        - The empty coalition (no player)
    - ordering does not matter within a coalition
- **Value of a Coalition -** Each coalition $S$ has an associated value $v(S)$ which represents the total benefit, profit, or outcome that the coalition can achieve by working together. The value function $v$  depends on the contributions of the players within that coalition.
- **Purpose**
    - understand how playersâ€™ cooperation can lead to different outcomes
    - how rewards or payoffs should be distributed among the players based on their contribution

## Shapley Value $\phi_i$

- **Goal** - measuring each player's contribution to the game
- Steps
    - **Identify Players and Coalitions -** Consider a set of players $N$, and a charactistic value function $v(S)$ which gives the value of any coalition $S  \subseteq N$
    - **Determine Marginal Contribution for player $i$ in coalition $S$**
        - suppose coalition $S' = S \backslash \{i\}$, which is coalition $S$ without player $i$
        - calculate the difference between the coalition $v(S) - v(S')$
    - Calculate Shapley Value $\phi_i$ for Player $i$
        - the weighted average of the marginal contribution across all possible coalitions

# SHAP in XGBoost

## Model itself as a cooperative game

- each feature is considered as a player the contributes to the prediction (the value of the game)
- using Tree SHAP algorithm - [example](https://shap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_notebooks/tabular_examples/tree_based_models/Basic%20SHAP%20Interaction%20Value%20Example%20in%20XGBoost.html)

## Stepwise

- **Path Tracking:** The algorithm tracks the paths taken by a given instance through the decision trees in the ensemble (XGBoost model).
- **Contribution Calculation:** For each tree, the algorithm calculates how the presence or absence of a feature influences the path taken by the instance. This involves measuring the change in the predicted value when a feature is included versus excluded.
- **Expected Value:** The calculation considers the expected contribution of a feature to the model's output, averaging over all possible permutations of feature orderings.
- **Aggregation Across Trees:** SHAP values from all individual trees in the ensemble are aggregated to produce the final SHAP value for each feature.

# **Self Comments**

## 2024.08

- Initial Use Case - understand individual feature contribute to xgboost model
    - after reading - not sure if this is the best tool?
    - marginal distribution when correlated features?
    - tree based model handle the missing by itself considering the local min - while feeding model without the target features to understand the contributor, not exactly one to one as model with this feature.
